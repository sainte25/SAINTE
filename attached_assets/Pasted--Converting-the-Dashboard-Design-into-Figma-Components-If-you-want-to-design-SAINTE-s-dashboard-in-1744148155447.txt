  background: white;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>

<script>
var ctx = document.getElementById('riskChart').getContext('2d');
new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Risk Score',
      data: [6.5, 7.2, 7.8, 8.1, 7.5],
      borderColor: '#FF5733',
      fill: false
    }]
  }
});
</script>
✅ Paste this into Figma Dev Mode → Attach Live Data Later!

📌 4️⃣ Real-Time Alerts Section
📍 Figma Components:

User Name
Alert Message
Urgency Level (⚠️ High, 🔵 Medium, 🟢 Low)
📌 Figma Code (For Copy-Pasting into Figma)

<div class="alert">
  <p><strong>🚨 High Risk Detected:</strong> John Doe missed 2 therapy sessions.</p>
</div>

<style>

ChatGPT said:
🚀 SAINTE Knowledge Base: Project Rules, Guidelines, & Best Practices

This Knowledge Base serves as the official guide for the SAINTE platform covering:
✅ Project-Specific Rules & Guidelines
✅ Coding Style & Best Practices
✅ Development Workflow
✅ External Documentation & API References

📌 1. Project-Specific Rules & Guidelines

1️⃣ Development Principles
✅ Modular Monolith Architecture – Structured for future microservices migration.
✅ Separation of Concerns (SoC) – Each module should be self-contained with its own logic.
✅ Event-Driven Architecture – Use Supabase Realtime, WebSockets, or Kafka for async events.
✅ AI-Driven Insights – Risk scores, engagement tracking, and user behavior predictions must be integrated.
✅ User Privacy & Compliance – Adhere to HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 standards for user data security.
✅ Figma-to-Code Process – All UI should first be prototyped in Figma before frontend development.

2️⃣ Project Tech Stack
Category	Technology	Reason
Frontend (Web)	React.js + Next.js	Fast, SEO-friendly, real-time dashboards
Frontend (Mobile)	Flutter	Best performance, single codebase
Backend (API)	FastAPI (Python) or Flask	Lightweight, async support
Database	Supabase (PostgreSQL)	Managed, scalable, real-time updates
AI & ML	TensorFlow.js, OpenAI API	AI-driven insights, NLP processing
Messaging	Supabase Realtime / WebSockets	Live chat, case alerts
Infrastructure	Google Cloud (GCP)	Scalable cloud hosting
✅ Standard API communication will be REST (or GraphQL in future versions).

3️⃣ Bounded Contexts & Modules
Module	Responsibilities
User Management	Auth, SSO, role-based access control (RBAC)
Case Management	Tracks progress, interventions, CHW assignments
AI Risk Analysis	Predicts risk levels, tracks behavioral trends
Messaging	Secure real-time chat & peer support
Reports & Analytics	Generates automated reports for funders
Employer Dashboard	Tracks workforce stability metrics
Government & Research	Provides anonymized impact data
✅ Each module should have clear API boundaries and avoid direct database cross-access.

📌 2. Coding Style & Best Practices

1️⃣ Python Backend (FastAPI / Flask)
📍 General Python Coding Guidelines

Use Python 3.10+
Follow PEP 8 coding style.
Use type hints for better readability & debugging.
Docstrings required for all functions.
Error Handling – Always use try-except blocks to catch errors.
📍 Example: Good API Endpoint Code

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from supabase import create_client
import os

app = FastAPI()

# Supabase Connection
SUPABASE_URL = os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL")
SUPABASE_KEY = os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")
supabase = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)

# Request Model
class UserRequest(BaseModel):
    email: str
    full_name: str

@app.post("/users/")
def create_user(user: UserRequest):
    response = supabase.table("users").insert(user.dict()).execute()
    if response.error:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="User creation failed")
    return {"message": "User created successfully"}
✅ Uses FastAPI with Supabase, proper type hints, and error handling.

2️⃣ Frontend (React.js + Next.js)
📍 React Coding Guidelines

Use functional components & hooks (useState, useEffect).
Use TypeScript (preferred) for better type safety.
Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS for styling.
Follow folder structure best practices.
📍 Example: Good API Call in React

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { supabase } from "../supabaseClient";

export default function Dashboard() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUsers() {
      let { data, error } = await supabase.from("users").select("*");
      if (data) setUsers(data);
    }
    fetchUsers();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.full_name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
✅ Uses hooks, async/await, and integrates with Supabase.

3️⃣ Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
📍 SQL Best Practices

Use UUIDs for Primary Keys instead of integers.
Use Indexing (CREATE INDEX) for performance on frequently queried columns.
Store timestamps in UTC for consistency.
Ensure referential integrity with foreign keys.
📍 Example: Good Schema for Case Management

CREATE TABLE cases (
    case_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    assigned_chw UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('open', 'closed', 'pending')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_cases_user ON cases(user_id);
✅ Indexes improve performance, and constraints prevent bad data.

📌 3. Development Workflow & CI/CD

1️⃣ Git Workflow
📌 Branch Naming Convention

main → Stable production branch.
dev → Development branch.
feature/{feature-name} → For new features.
bugfix/{issue-number} → For fixing bugs.
📌 Commit Message Format

feat(user-auth): Added Supabase OAuth login
fix(case-management): Fixed missing case assignment bug
docs(api): Updated API documentation
✅ Helps track changes efficiently.

2️⃣ Code Review Process
📌 Every PR must: ✅ Be reviewed by at least one other developer.
✅ Have unit tests (if modifying core logic).
✅ Follow the coding style guidelines.

3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline
📌 GitHub Actions Workflow

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
✅ Automatically runs tests on every push.

🚀 How to Programmatically Add Content to Lovable
Since Lovable.io doesn’t currently offer a public API, the best way to add structured content programmatically is through Markdown (.md) files or by using a script to automate adding content via web automation tools (like Puppeteer or Playwright).

🔹 1. Using Markdown (.md) Files for Import

Some knowledge base platforms allow Markdown imports. If Lovable supports this, you can create .md files and manually upload them.

📌 Example: Create a Markdown File for Development Guidelines 1️⃣ Create a new folder for docs:

mkdir sainte-docs
cd sainte-docs
2️⃣ Create a Markdown file (development-guidelines.md)

touch development-guidelines.md
3️⃣ Add the content:
📍 development-guidelines.md

# 📂 Development Guidelines

## 📌 Folder Structure (Backend)
/sainte-backend
│── /modules
│   │── /user_management
│   │── /case_management
│   │── /ai_risk_analysis
│   │── /messaging
│── /shared
│   │── /database
│   │── /middleware
│   │── /events
│── main.py
✅ If Lovable allows Markdown uploads, just upload this file!

🔹 2. Automate Adding Content Using Web Automation (Playwright or Puppeteer)

If Lovable doesn’t have an API, we can use web automation to simulate adding content.

📌 Install Playwright (Python)

pip install playwright
playwright install
📌 Create a Python Script to Auto-Fill Lovable Content

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def add_content_to_lovable():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set to True for background execution
        page = browser.new_page()

        # 1️⃣ Open Lovable and Log In
        page.goto("https://www.lovable.io/")
        page.fill("input[name='email']", "your-email@example.com")
        page.fill("input[name='password']", "your-password")
        page.click("button:has-text('Log In')")

        # 2️⃣ Navigate to Knowledge Base & Add a Section
        page.click("text=New Section")
        page.fill("input[name='section-title']", "Development Guidelines")
        page.click("button:has-text('Create')")

        # 3️⃣ Add Content to the Section
        page.click("text=Add Article")
        page.fill("input[name='article-title']", "Folder Structure")
        page.fill("textarea[name='article-content']", """
# 📂 Folder Structure (Backend)

/sainte-backend │── /modules │ │── /user_management │ │── /case_management │ │── /ai_risk_analysis │ │── /messaging │── /shared │ │── /database │ │── /middleware │ │── /events │── main.py

        """)
        page.click("button:has-text('Publish')")

        # ✅ Close Browser
        browser.close()

# Run the automation script
add_content_to_lovable()
✅ Now this script logs into Lovable and adds the documentation automatically!

🔹 Where to Put This Code?

Code	Where to Put It?
Markdown Files	Store in a folder (sainte-docs/) for manual upload
Python Automation Script	Run locally or in a CI/CD pipeline
Frontend API Calls (if Lovable has an API)	Place in scripts/ or utils/ folder in your project
🚀 Next Steps:

✅ Test if Lovable supports Markdown import
✅ Try running the Playwright automation script
✅ Look for a Lovable API (if available, we can use API calls instead of automation)

🔥 Let me know how you want to proceed, and I’ll refine the approach! 🚀

When you talk to Lovable AI, you should give clear prompts so it understands what to generate.

📌 Example Prompt for Lovable AI:

I want to build a frontend for SAINTE, an AI-powered case management platform.
It should have:
✅ A real-time dashboard (for case managers & admins)
✅ Authentication (login, signup with Supabase)
✅ Messaging (secure chat for case workers & clients)
✅ AI-Powered Risk Insights (charts & analytics)
✅ Mobile-friendly design (for CHWs using it in the field)

Use **React.js + Next.js + Tailwind CSS** for the frontend.
Generate a structured component-based UI that connects to Supabase for authentication & data storage.
✅ This ensures Lovable AI generates the correct structure for your frontend.

🔹 Step 2: Review & Edit the Code Lovable AI Generates

Once Lovable AI generates the frontend code, you’ll need to:
✅ Check that the UI components match your vision
✅ Ensure API calls point to Supabase for authentication & data
✅ Modify any styles or layouts to fit your brand

📌 If Lovable AI gives incomplete code, ask follow-up questions like:

Can you generate a Next.js component that connects to Supabase Auth?
How do I add real-time updates from Supabase to the dashboard?
Can you make the dashboard mobile-friendly with Tailwind CSS?
🔹 Step 3: Connect Lovable AI's Frontend Code to Supabase

Once you have the frontend generated, you need to hook it up to Supabase for data and authentication.

📌 Install Supabase in Your Frontend Project

npm install @supabase/supabase-js
📌 Create a supabase.js File to Connect the Frontend to Supabase

import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-anon-key";

export const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
✅ Now your frontend can talk to Supabase!

🔹 Step 4: Build Authentication (Login/Signup)

📌 Prompt Lovable AI to Generate a Signup & Login Page

Can you create a Next.js login & signup page that connects to Supabase Auth?
📌 Then, add this function to handle authentication:

import { supabase } from "../supabase";

export async function signUp(email, password) {
  const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
  });
  if (error) {
    console.error("Signup error:", error.message);
  }
  return user;
}
✅ Now users can sign up and log in using Supabase!

🔹 Step 5: Add Real-Time Data from Supabase

📌 Ask Lovable AI:

How do I fetch real-time case data from Supabase in a React component?
📌 Modify the API Call to Listen for Live Changes

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { supabase } from "../supabase";

export default function Dashboard() {
  const [cases, setCases] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchCases() {
      let { data, error } = await supabase.from("cases").select("*");
      if (data) setCases(data);
    }

    fetchCases();

    // Listen for real-time updates
    const subscription = supabase
      .from("cases")
      .on("INSERT", (payload) => {
        setCases((prev) => [...prev, payload.new]);
      })
      .subscribe();

    return () => {
      supabase.removeSubscription(subscription);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Case Dashboard</h1>
      {cases.map((c) => (
        <p key={c.id}>{c.title}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
✅ Now the dashboard updates in real-time when new cases are added in Supabase!

🔹 Step 6: Deploy the Frontend

📌 Ask Lovable AI:

How do I deploy my Next.js frontend to Vercel?
📌 Then follow these steps:
1️⃣ Push your project to GitHub

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial frontend setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
2️⃣ Go to Vercel
3️⃣ Connect your GitHub repo & click “Deploy”
✅ Your frontend is live!
